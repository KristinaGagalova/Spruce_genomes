Updated results of the spruce giga-genomes paper - Gagalova et al., 2022

## Source
Updated results as in ["Annotation of complex genomes for comparative genomics"](https://open.library.ubc.ca/soa/cIRcle/collections/ubctheses/24/items/1.0412903) - &copy; Kristina K. Gagalova        
Chapter 2 **"Comparative genome annotation of four North American spruces (*Picea*, Pinaceae)"** 

The results include the following:           
● Phylogeny of single-copy protein-coding genes          
● Analysis of positive selection on orthologous genes         
● Updated phylogeny described in Gagalova et al. with resampling information     
● Updated gene family expansion/contraction analysis with accurate species tree (better separation between spruces and pines)
